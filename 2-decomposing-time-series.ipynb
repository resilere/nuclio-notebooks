    "### Components of a Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is composed of mainly trend, seasonality, and noise. We will take a look at the component parts of a time series, focusing on automated decomposition methods. This will give you some intuition about the components of time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trend\n",
    "When we talk about trend, we are talking about how the series data increases or decreases over time.  Is it moving higher or lower over  the time frame? The series is either uptrend or downtrend, both of which are non-stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seasonality\n",
    "Seasonality refers to a repeating periodic or cyclical pattern with regular intervals within a series.  The pattern is within a fixed time period and it repeats itself at regular intervals. There can be upward or downward swings but it continues to repeat over a fixed period of time as in a cycle.  Cyclicality could repeat but it has no fixed period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Noise\n",
    "In general, noise captures the irregularities or random variation in the series.  It can have erratic events or simply random variation.  It has a short duration.  It is hard to predict due to its erratic occurrence."

    "The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) gives the partial correlation of a time series with its own lagged values. It controls for other lags. The idea for the PACF is that we perform correlation between a variable and itself lagged and then we subtract that effect from the variable and then find out what residual correlation is left over from that variable and further lags. For example, a PACF of order 3 returns the correlation between our time series (t1, t2, t3, ...) and its own values lagged by 3 time points (t4, t5, t6, ...), but only after removing all effects attributable to lags 1 and 2."
